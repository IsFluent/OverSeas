# Post 1 - Childhood Games
> A thing that intrigued me a lot during my childhood was childhood games I'd play with my classmates sometimes when we were bored. One of those games was something called chopsticks, a game where at the beginning you stick out both of your hands' pointer fingers which represent the number “1” for each hand. If I remember correctly, the mechanics of the game is there are continuous rounds where two players take turns using one of their hands to bump one of the opponents hands, when, say, I use my right hand which has only its pointer finger stuck out and bump the opponents one hand which also represents "1", this opponents hand will now take on the value "2" and he/she will stick out the usual two fingers that represent "2". Whenever a hand takes on the exact value of "5", that hand is gone. If for example a hand takes on the value "6“，this hand will become a "1". The goal of the game is to eventually make your all of your opponent's hands gone. 

> A cool thing that happened after I moved to China was there appeared to be a very similar game there. I think it's called "一加一" (One plus one) but I'm not so sure. The thing about these childhood games is that it could have appered before the internet was born, meaning that these games are usually spread across people by word and experience playing. So, if the two games I mentioned above really do have a link, I think that would just be incredible.
